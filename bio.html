		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p><span class="biotitles">Biography</span></p>
		<p>I am an imperious, uber-nerd genius totally lacking in social skills. I am the smartest person I know and frequently remind people of this. I am a creature of routine and become distressed when my comfortable world is upset. I do not drive, but expect others to give me rides free of charge because that's their job. I cannot let someone else misspeak without being corrected and am fond of long, belabored explanations.</p>

		<p>I occasionally crack myself up and am a fan of pranks, which I punctuate with a <span class="bazinga">"Bazinga!"</span>, my favorate catch phrase. I am aware that others see me as a nerd, but I have very little time for what others think of me, since I am so much smarter than them. I also keep track of when I feel wronged by people, assigning "strikes," after three the offender has the choice to appologize, be banished from my apartment for a year, or take a class.</p>
	
		<p><span class="biotitles">Background</span></p>
		<p>I was born in Galveston, Texas in 1980. My mother is extremely religious and my father died when I was young due to health problems related to his weight. I have an older brother named George Jr. and a twin sister named Missy, who does not share my intellect.
		I was bullied constantly as a child and conducted frequent science experiments, many of which resulted in minor damage or bodily injury.

		<p><span class="biotitles">Education and Interests</span></p>
		<p>I started college when I was 11 and received my first Ph.D when I was 16. My current field of study is on string theory and M-theory and I also have an interest in high energy colliders and nuclear fusion. I have a photographic memory and am keenly interested in hygiene. I am a fan of comic books, Star Wars, Star Trek (I speak Klingon), Battlestar Galactica and Doctor Who, but hate Babylon 5. </p>
